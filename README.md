# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems as part of my ongoing journey to improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## About

I created this repository to document my progress with LeetCode problems, improve my coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory with the following naming convention:

```
XXXX-problem-name/
    XXXX-problem-name.py
    README.md
```

Where:

- `XXXX` is the LeetCode problem number
- Each directory contains the solution file and problem description

## My Approach

When solving problems, I focus on:

- Writing clean, efficient code
- Implementing optimal algorithms
- Understanding multiple approaches
- Documenting my thought process

## How to Use

- Browse the repository to explore solutions by problem number
- Each solution includes comments explaining the approach
- Problem statements are preserved in the README files
