# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems as part of my ongoing practice and learning journey in data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory with the following naming convention:

```
XXXX-problem-name/
    XXXX-problem-name.py
    README.md
```

Where:

- `XXXX` is the LeetCode problem number (with leading zeros)
- `problem-name` is the name of the problem
- Each directory contains:
  - The solution file (`.py` file)
  - A `README.md` with the problem description

## Approach

In this repository, I focus on:

- Writing clean and efficient code
- Using optimal algorithms to solve problems
- Understanding different approaches to solve the same problem
- Improving my problem-solving skills

## Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Track my progress over time

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions. Each solution is documented with:

- The problem statement (in the README.md file)
- My implementation of the solution

## Future Improvements

- Add time and space complexity analysis for each solution
- Implement solutions in multiple programming languages
- Add detailed explanations of the approach used for each problem
